# Superstore Analytics

## üìå Overview
This project analyzes sales and profitability using the **Superstore dataset**.  
The goal is to understand sales performance, profitability, and customer trends using **PostgreSQL** and **Power BI**.

## üìä Dataset
- **Source:** Superstore sample dataset (public, used widely in BI training)
- **Size:** ~10,000 rows (this repo includes the file used for this project: `superstore.csv`)
- **Privacy:** Public, no sensitive information

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools
- PostgreSQL
- SQL (CTEs, window functions, aggregates, joins)
- Power BI (dashboards & KPIs)

## ‚ùì Key Business Questions
1. Which are the total sales per product?
2. Which product categories and subcategories drive the most profit?
3. How do sales trends by category?
4. how YoY growth by sales and profit have changed over the years based on product¬¥s category?
5. What customer segments and region combined are most valuable?

## üìÇ Repository Structure
- `sql/` ‚Üí database schema, load script, and analysis queries
- `docs/` ‚Üí sample dataset, ERD
- `images/` ‚Üí screenshots of dashboards (power BI) and queries results (PGadmin)
- `README.md` ‚Üí project summary and instructions

## üöÄ How to Reproduce
1. Create a new PostgreSQL database:
The way i did it was directly in PGadmin, in the workspace (the menu at the left) there is the Server section which is localy in my PC, then right-click on databases and create - database, then put the name in this case superstore and click save.

2. Creating queries at the Query tool workspace (the second icon in the left menu) and start creating tables and importing data, the script i used are in the sql folder as follow:
   [SCHEMA](sql/SCHEMA.sql)

3. Then i created another query workspace so i dont mix queries from the schema into analysis .. does can be found at [Analysis](sql/Analysis.sql)

## Database Schema & ERD

The data is normalized into these tables:

- `customers` (customer info + region etc.)  
- `orders` (order-level info)  
- `products` (product catalog)  
- `order_details` (line-item level: sales, quantity, profit etc.)

**Relationships:**

- Each `order` links to one customer.  
- `order_details` links orders to products (many-to-many through that table).

## üìä Power BI Integration

For the visualization layer, I connected Power BI directly to PostgreSQL:

- All SQL queries were first developed and validated in **pgAdmin**.  
- Using the native PostgreSQL connector, these queries were imported into Power BI.  
- This workflow allowed me to rely on **SQL for all data modeling and transformations**, keeping Power BI focused on the **visualization and storytelling** aspects.  


## Images shared
- Example or query and results from top selling category [Highlight top selling category](images/Highlight_top_selling_category.png)
- Example of profit hotspot [Profit Hotspot](images/profit_hotspot.png)
- Ready chart on powerBI sammple of some queries into 2 different images
     * superstore sales analysis **** [Superstore Analysis](images/superstore_analysis.png)
       In this one we see a overall profitability of the "company" or in this case the superstore database
     * superstore sales analisys 2 **** [Superstore Analysis 2](images/superstore_analysis_2.png)
       we can see on this image some interesting charts on how the rank changes over the years by profit and sales, that rank changes can be usefull for the impact it has on sellings
       the higher number on rank means the low selling products for example or less sales.
       We can see same for YoY growth by profit and sales and a overall top sellers each year.
